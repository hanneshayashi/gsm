// driveLabelsPublishCmd represents the publish command
var driveLabelsPublishCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "publish",
	Short: `Publishes a Label`,
	Long: `Publish all draft changes to the Label.
Once published, the Label may not return to its draft state.
See google.apps.drive.labels.v2.Lifecycle for more information.

Publishing a Label will result in a new published revision.
All previous draft revisions will be deleted.
Previous published revisions will be kept but are subject to automated deletion as needed.

Once published, some changes are no longer permitted.
Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing metadata related to the Label will be rejected.
For example, the following changes to a Label will be rejected after the Label is published:
* The label cannot be directly deleted. It must be disabled first, then deleted.
* Field.FieldType cannot be changed.
* Changes to Field validation options cannot reject something that was previously accepted.
* Reducing the max entries.
