	Use:   "create",
	Short: "Adds a delegate with its verification status set directly to accepted, without sending any verification email.",
	Long: `The delegate user must be a member of the same Workspace organization as the delegator user.

Gmail imposes limitations on the number of delegates and delegators each user in a Workspace organization can have. These limits depend on your organization, but in general each user can have up to 25 delegates and up to 10 delegators.

Note that a delegate user must be referred to by their primary email address, and not an email alias.

Also note that when a new delegate is created, there may be up to a one minute delay before the new delegate is available for use.
